			<h2>ABOUT: HASHIMA ISLAND</h2>
			<p>A small, deserted island off the coast of Nagasaki known as Gunkanjima (端島, or simply Hashima, as -shima is a Japanese suffix for island), commonly called Gunkanjima (軍艦島, meaning Battleship Island) is located about 15 kilometers (8 nautical miles) from the city's center. The 16-acre (6.3 hectare) island was famous for its undersea coal mines, which were built in 1887 and ran during Japan's industrialization. In 1959, the island's population peaked at 5,259 people. The mine was shut down in 1974 when the island's coal reserves were getting low, and the occupants quickly left. For the next three decades, the island was essentially abandoned.</p>

                <div class="ownership">
            <div class="content">
                <p>Mitsubishi controlled the island up until 2002, when Takashima Town willingly took ownership of it. Currently, Takashima Island is governed by Nagasaki City, which took over Takashima Town in 2005. Only journalists were allowed to land on August 23, 2005, according to city hall. The repair of a pier for visitor landings was scheduled to take place in April 2008 by Nagasaki City at the time. A visiting promenade measuring 220 meters (722 feet) in length was also envisioned, and access to dangerous building areas was to be restricted. However, the city declared that public access would be postponed until the spring of 2009 as a result of the development's construction delay at the end of 2007. Due to the potential for building on the waterfront to collapse, the city also faced safety concerns.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY OF HASHIMA ISLAND</h2>
                <p>The real history of Hashima Island, which is located in the East China Sea off the coast of Nagasaki, is almost equally spectacular. The little island was a significant Japanese coal mine with tunnels that reached approximately 2,000 feet below the surface from the 1880s until it was unexpectedly abandoned in 1974. The government has made it mandatory for visitors to only travel as a member of an authorized tour group because no one knows when they might collapse. On the island, also known as "Prison Island" or "Hell Island," some of the forced Korean laborers made unsuccessful attempts to flee. All of the escapees either drowned while trying to reach land or were taken prisoner by the Japanese. In actuality, there is no documentation of any employees who were successful in leaving the island. Total laborers tortured to death on the island by the end of World War II were 722 Chinese and 1,442 Korean. Hashima Island's coal mines were first opened in 1887, and by the 1950s, more than 5,000 people were residing on just 16 acres of land, making it one of the world's most densely populated areas. However, the mines were shut down and the island was abandoned in 1974 when the market for coal declined. Around 1,300 of those recruited laborers are thought to have perished on the island during this time owing to a variety of hazards, such as accidents underground, tiredness, and malnutrition. </p>

                    <div class="population">
                    <p>In the 1950s, the most densely populated place on Earth was a Japanese island nine miles off of Nagasaki. Today, it would be hard to imagine any place lonelier. To accommodate the horde of workers that Hashima's mine demanded, enormous residential towers—the country's first significant concrete structures—were constructed. On a smaller area than many sports stadiums in 1959, there were 5,259 residents living there. This resulted in the island having a higher population density than any other island in the world, with almost 216,000 people per square mile. formerly the region with the highest density of people. It is currently one of the 505 deserted islands of Nagasaki and includes a large number of abandoned structures in addition to undersea coal mines that were first constructed in 1887. As a key site during the Meiji Industrial Revolution, Hashima has been reopened to tourism since 2009 and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site (as of 2015). The usage of forced labor by South Korean and Chinese migrants on the Island raised objections from South Korea, but an agreement was made when Japan promised to include the history in the information given to tourists.</p>
